# PCA-augmentation
This work allows augmenting training data using nested distillations of data vectors based on principal component analysis. This approach efficiently extends the amount of training data for deep learning and increases classification accuracy.

The code is accompanying the article "Training Data Augmentation with Data Distilled by the Principal Component Analysis" by Nikolay M. Sirakov, Tahsin Shahnewaz, and Arie Nakhmani.
